1) Predictions:
- It will make an alert that prints out the innerHTML of the table element you click on
Observations:
- It does exactly as predicted

- I liked the modularity of the adding of the event listeners

2) Predictions:
- It will make an alert that prints out the innerHTML of the table column element you click, then prints out the innerHTML of the table row it is in,
then prints out the innerHTML of the entire table
Observations:
- It does exactly as predicted
- Alerts appear one at a time

3) Predictions:
- Perhaps the same thing as #2?
Observations:
- The parent has a true parameter in its addEventListener
- The parent innerHTML is alerted first, and the other two are the same as the first two of #2 in order

- The true parameter pushed up the parent table's command to be run first before its children
- Perhaps stopPropagation stops following alerts from showing up after the first one

4) Predictions:
- Perhaps the same thing as #2?
Observations:
- The alerts were in parent, child order
- The ordering of the event listeners do not matter when you have the true parameter
